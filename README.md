This is the 4-th assignment in the OOP course.
It features automated robots that collect fruit for a high score.
It is now possible to log in to a database and upload the results to a server.
GUI now displays the scores and info about the game. It may look similar to the previous release, however, much of the code has been rewritten.  
A jar file _OOP_Ex4.jar_ is included in the root of the project for your convenience.
