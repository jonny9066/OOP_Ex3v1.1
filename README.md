The third assignment in the OOP course in the Ariel University.  
Based in the GameServer jar that is included, this program allows to select a level and play it either manually or let the computer play for you. What you get is a GUI built using StdDraw that displays the level, the robots and the fruit.  Addittionally, every level is exported to KML for viewing the game in Google Maps or Google Earth (levels are based on geographical locations).
